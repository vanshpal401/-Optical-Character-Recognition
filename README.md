## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   Open your command line interface (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install easyocr gradio numpy
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Create a new Python file** (if you havenâ€™t done so):
   Create a file named `app.py` and copy your code into it.

2. **Navigate to the directory** where your `app.py` file is located:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   Execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Gradio interface**:
   After running the script, you should see output in your command line indicating that Gradio is launching. Open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860/`).

## Deployment

### Sharing with Gradio Hub

You can share your app with others using Gradio Hub. To do this:

1. Sign up for a Gradio account.
2. Follow the instructions on the [Gradio documentation](https://gradio.app/docs/#share) to upload and share your app.

### Deploying on Cloud Platforms

If you want to deploy your Gradio app on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud, follow these general steps:

1. **Set up a web server** using Flask or FastAPI.
2. **Create a `requirements.txt`** file that includes all dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Follow platform-specific deployment instructions** to push your code to the cloud.

## Usage

1. **Upload an image**: Click on the "Upload Image" button and select an image file containing text.
2. **Enter a keyword**: Type in a keyword to search and highlight within the extracted text.
3. **View results**: The application will display the extracted text, JSON output, and highlighted text.
